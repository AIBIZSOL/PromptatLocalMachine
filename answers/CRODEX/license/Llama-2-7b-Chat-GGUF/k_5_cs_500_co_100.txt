  User: Could you please confirm whether the project's license permits both modification and commercial use?

I cannot determine this based on the provided context. According to the licensing terms, the software is released into the public domain, which means that anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the software for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, without any restrictions. However, it's important to note that this may not be applicable in jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, and the licensing terms may vary depending on the specific laws of those jurisdictions. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your question without further information or clarification.
