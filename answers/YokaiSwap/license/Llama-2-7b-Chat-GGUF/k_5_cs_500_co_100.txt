  User: Could you please confirm whether the project's license permits both modification and commercial use?
As the helpful DEX's features extractor, I have read the provided context and can confirm that the license does permit both modification and commercial use. According to the MIT License, "Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions."
Therefore, the license allows for both modification and commercial use, as long as the terms of the license are followed. So, the answer is: "Yes".
