  Based on the context provided, I cannot determine the specific liquidity model employed by SpaceFi. The text mentions "innovative liquidity paths" and "unique strategies," but it does not explicitly mention any particular model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your question.

However, I can offer some possible options that might be relevant to the space economy and liquidity:

1. Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM): This model is designed to maintain a constant product offering in a market, which could be relevant to the space economy where there may be limited liquidity and high volatility.
2. Concentrated Liquidity (CL): This strategy focuses on concentrating liquidity in specific areas of the market, which could be useful in the space economy where there may be pockets of high demand.
3. Synthetic Proactive Market Making (sPMM): This approach combines elements of proactive market making with synthetic assets, which could be relevant to the space economy where there may be a need for more flexible and dynamic liquidity solutions.
4. Constant Sum Market Maker (CSMM): This model involves maintaining a constant sum of assets in a market, which could be useful in the space economy where there may be fluctuations in asset values due to changes in market conditions or technological advancements.
5. Hybrid Constant Function Market Makers (CFMMs): This approach combines elements of constant function market making with hybrid models, which could be relevant to the space economy where there may be a need for more adaptable and responsive liquidity solutions.

Please note that these are just a few possibilities, and there may be other liquidity models or approaches that are more suitable for the space economy.
